Notes for workshop facilitators
===============================

Orientation presentation
------------------------

It is suggested to begin the workshop with a short "orientation"
presentation, which should cover:

- Goals of the workshop
- Curriculum overview
- High-level IdM concepts
- High-level FreeIPA architecture
- Further resources (this can be covered at end of workshop)

Here is an example presentation you are welcome to use:

Feedback
--------

Please offer participants the opportunity to provide feedback about
their workshop.  It should include questions about their technical
background and prior general IdM knowledge, as well as whether the
workshop helped them learn FreeIPA, how difficult it was, etc.
